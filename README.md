# ASAG-Dataset
Assisted ~Automated~ Short Answer Grading Dataset

The repository contains the dataset collected for short answer grading, we have created a dataset for Assistive short answer grading from an exam of neural network course. The course was taken by graduate students of University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. For each question the answers were collected via jupyter notebooks.  38 students took the examination and each exam had 17 questions. Thus the dataset has a total of 646 question answers.
The answers were graded by a single human judge, using an integer scale from 0(completely incorrect), 1(partially correct) and 2(perfect answer).
Figure below shows the distribution of grades in the dataset.
